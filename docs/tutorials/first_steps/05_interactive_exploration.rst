Interactively explore the flights data
--------------------------------------

At this point in a data-science project, you would normally start by looking at
the data, trying to understand its structure, and see how to go about answering
our question: *how many flights had Austin, TX as their destination.*

In this tutorial, we will jump-start the process by using some notebooks and scripts 
that have already been prepared.

For a Jupyter notebook view, go to `the first example notebook 
<https://renkulab.io/projects/renku-tutorials/renku-tutorial-flights-material/files/blob/notebooks/FilterFlights.ipynb>`_
and download the file to your computer (Note: some browsers might change the
file extension to ``.txt`` - make sure to change it to ``.ipynb`` if that is the
case!). Go to the ``notebooks`` directory in your running interactive session
and drag and drop the downloaded notebook there. To save the notebook run

.. code-block:: console

    $ renku save -m "Created notebook to filter flights to AUS, TX."

    Successfully saved to branch master:
          notebooks/FilterFlights.ipynb
    OK

You should look at the respective notebook or script to understand the logic.
You can execute the relevant steps iteratively if you are new to this type of
data wrangling.
