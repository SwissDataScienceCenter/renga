Interactive Environments on RenkuLab
====================================

RenkuLab provides convenient interactive computing environments based on
`JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. You can use them
to quickly access your project in fully-configured Python, RStudio or Julia
sessions. They make it easy to collaborate by providing reproducible
computational sessions for everyone working together on a project. They can
even be used to host interactive dashboards running on live data for use
in demos or presentations. Note the interactive environments are transient objects. Changes to code and data which need to be persisted have to be :ref:`pushed to the GitLab server<saving>`.

All aspects of creating, using, and modifying interactive sessions on RenkuLab
are covered on the pages that follow:
