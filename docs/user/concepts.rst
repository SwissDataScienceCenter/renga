Renku Concepts
==================

The goal of Renku is to provide data scientists with simple tools to make
their work reproducible, repeatable, reusable and shareable. To achieve these
ends, we glue together many different technologies and approaches from  data
science, computer science and software engineering. The pages below serve as
an introduction to these concepts so that you as a user have a better
understanding of what takes place behind the scenes as you work with the
Renku platform.
