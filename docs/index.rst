The Renku Project Docs
======================

.. epigraph::

   **Renku** (連句 "linked verses"), is a Japanese form of popular
   collaborative linked verse poetry, written by more than one author
   working together.*

   -- Wikipedia

**The Renku Project** aims to foster multidisciplinary (data) science collaboration.

It consists of:

* :ref:`Renkulab <renkulab>`, a web-based platform designed to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility.
* :ref:`Renku <renku>`, a command-line interface (CLI) for managing code, datasets, and workflows that you can use on Renkulab or pip install locally.

We have a public instance of **renkulab** at https://renkulab.io, and several other
deployments at various institutions. Go ahead - log in, try it out, and `let us
know what you think <http://bit.ly/renku-feedback>`_! You can follow the
:ref:`first_steps` tutorial in python or R :)

If you are looking for detailed **renku** command-line interface (CLI) documentation,
consult the `renku-python docs <https://renku-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_!
