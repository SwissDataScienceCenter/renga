Welcome to Renku!
=================

**Renku** is a software platform designed to enable reproducible and
collaborative data science.

The platform:

* Allows data scientists to easily make their analyses reproducible by
  automatically capturing the lineage of results in a Knowledge Graph

* Turns parts of recorded data science pipelines into building blocks that can
  be reused by others in their own analyses

* Provides tools for working with the Knowledge Graph for the purposes of
  traceability and auditability

If you are a data scientist looking to get started with Renku, head to the
:ref:`first_steps` tutorial for a quick look at how Renku can be used for a
data science project. To read up on the concepts behind Renku, you may go
straight to the :ref:`concepts` pages.

If you are a developer or a service provider, have a look at the
:ref:`developer_documentation` for information about installation, deployment,
and architecture.
