The Renku Project Docs
======================

.. epigraph::

   **Renku** (連句 "linked verses"), is a Japanese form of popular
   collaborative linked verse poetry, written by more than one author
   working together.*

   -- Wikipedia

**The Renku Project** provides a platform and tools for reproducible and
collaborative data analysis. It is aimed at independent researchers and data
scientists as well as labs, collaborations, and courses and workshops. Renku can
be used by anyone who deals with data, whether they are a researcher, data
analyst, project owner, or data provider.

It consists of:

* :ref:`Renkulab <renkulab>`, a web-based platform designed to facilitate
  collaboration, reproducibility, and discovery.

* :ref:`Renku <renku>`, a command-line interface (CLI) for managing code,
  datasets, and workflows that you can use on Renkulab or install locally.

A public instance of **Renkulab** is available at https://renkulab.io, and several
other deployments at various institutions. Go ahead - log in, try it out, and
`let us know what you think <http://bit.ly/renku-feedback>`_! You can follow the
:ref:`first_steps` tutorial in python or R or :ref:`continue reading about the
Renku project <renku_introduction>`.


If you are looking for detailed **renku** command-line interface (CLI) documentation,
consult the `renku-python docs <https://renku-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
