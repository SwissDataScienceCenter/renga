=================

**Renku** is a software platform designed to enable reproducible data science
and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

The platform allows (data)scientists to:

* Capture complete lineage of results up to original raw data for detailed traceability,
  auditability & reproducibility.

* Take advantage of recorded lineage for re-generating results with new data or code

* Share their work and reuse the work of others as building blocks in their
  own analyses
