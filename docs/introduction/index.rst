About Renku
===========

**The Renku Project** provides a platform and tools for reproducible and
collaborative data analysis. It is aimed at independent researchers and data
scientists as well as labs, collaborations, and courses and workshops. Renku can
be used by anyone who deals with data, whether they are a researcher, data
analyst, project owner, or data provider.

Renku is developed as an open source project by the Swiss Data Science Center in a
team split between EPFL and ETHZ.
