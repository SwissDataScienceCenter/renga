Why Renku?
----------

If you carry out research or analysis with code and data, chances are you will
be faced with answering the following questions:

* How do I repeat an analysis I did 1 month ago?
* How does new data change my results?
* How can I easily share my analysis with others?
* How is this type of data or algorithm usually used?
* Who is using my data or my algorithms?

The toolchain required to answer all of these questions comfortably is
long and complex. The **Renku Project** aims to provide researchers with easy
access to these state-of-the-art tools to improve reproducibility,
increase productivity and enable collaboration.
