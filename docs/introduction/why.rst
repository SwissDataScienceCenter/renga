Why Renku?
==========

If you carry out research or analysis with code and data, chances are you will
be faced with answering the following questions:

* How do I re-run an analysis I did a month ago?
* How does new data change my results?
* How can I easily share my analysis with others?
* How is this type of data or algorithm usually used?
* Who is using my data or my algorithms?

The toolchain required to answer all of these questions is long and complex. The
**Renku Project** provides easy access to these state-of-the-art tools to
improve reproducibility, increase productivity through reusability and enable
collaboration.

Renku can be used by

**Researchers** to:

* automatically capture the dependencies of their analysis inputs and outputs

* share research results though live interactive environments

* discover and publish data

**Data owners** to:

* bundle data with rich metadata to facilitate use and reuse

* discover uses of their data

* connect with analysts for collaboration

**Educators** to:

* prepare zero-install environments for courses

* manage resource access and in-class collaboration
