Why Renku?
==========

If you carry out research or analysis with code and data, chances are you will
be faced with answering the following questions:

* How do I repeat an analysis I did 1 month ago?
* How does new data change my results?
* How can I easily share my analysis with others?
* How is this type of data or algorithm usually used?
* Who is using my data or my algorithms?

The tool-chain required to answer all of these questions comfortably is
long and complex. The **Renku Project** aims to provide researchers with easy
access to these state-of-the-art tools to improve reproducibility,
increase productivity through reusability and enable collaboration.

Renku can be used by

**researchers** to:

* automatically capture the dependencies of their analysis inputs and outputs

* share research results though live interactive environments

* discover and publish data

**data owners** to:

* bundle data with rich metadata to facilitate use and reuse

* discover uses of their data

* connect with analysts for collaboration

**educators** to:

* prepare just-bring-a-browser courses

* manage resource access and in-class collaboration
