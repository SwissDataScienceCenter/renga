What is Renku?
==============

The Renku Project is a web platform (:ref:`renkulab`) and a command-line
interface (:ref:`renku`) built on top of open source components for researchers,
data scientists, educators, and students to help manage:

* code,
* data,
* execution environments, and
* workflows

Renku combines many widely-used open-source tools in order to make any project
on the platform reproducible, repeatable, reusable and shareable from the start.
Version control for data and code, containerization for runtime environments and
automatic workflow capture are the core pillars on which the platform is built.

Renku can be used by

**researchers** to:

* automatically capture the dependencies of their analysis inputs and outputs

* share research results though live interactive environments

* discover and publish data

**data owners** to:

* bundle data with rich metadata to facilitate use and reuse

* discover uses of their data

* connect with analysts for collaboration

**educators** to:

* prepare just-bring-a-browser courses

* manage resource access and in-class collaboration

To lean more about the hosted part of the platform, read about :ref:`Renkulab
