What is Renku?
--------------

The Renku Project is a web platform (:ref:`renkulab`) and a command-line interface (:ref:`renku`)
built on top of open source components for researchers, data scientists, educators,
and students to help manage:

* code (e.g. ``script.py``, ``script.R``, ``script.bat``, ...),
* data (e.g. ``data.csv``, ``data.h5``, ``data.zip``, ...),
* execution environments (e.g. ``requirements.txt``, ``Dockerfile``, ...), and
* workflows (e.g. ``workflow.cwl``, ...)

in a way that helps make research:

* repeatable,
* reproducible,
* reusable, and
* shareable

It is developed as an open source project by the Swiss Data Science Center in a
team split between EPFL and ETHZ.
