What is Renku?
--------------

The Renku Project is a web platform (:ref:`renkulab`) and a command-line
interface (:ref:`renku`) built on top of open source components for researchers,
data scientists, educators, and students to help manage:

* code,
* data,
* execution environments, and
* workflows

in a way that helps make research:

* repeatable,
* reproducible,
* reusable, and
* shareable


Renku can be used by


**researchers** to:

* automatically capture the dependencies of their analysis inputs and outputs

* share research results though live interactive environments

* discover and publish data

**data owners** to:

* bundle data with rich metadata

* discover uses of their data

* connect with analysts for collaboration

**educators** to:

* prepare just-bring-a-browser courses

* manage resource access and in-class collaboration


Renku is developed as an open source project by the Swiss Data Science Center in a
team split between EPFL and ETHZ.
