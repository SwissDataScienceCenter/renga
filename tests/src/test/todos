x make the DSL nice so we can pass the 'answers'
x the commands logging (stout is probably not the best)
x make the exception to appear when a command execution fail
x maybe an issue for debug logging
x do the whole flights tutorial in the new way
x do renku install / verify the version
x git push and auth - maybe inputing username and password is fine
x add info how to prepare local env so you can run the tests from an IDE
x configure global git username and email on the local machine if not done yet (git config --global user.name)
x integrate the new flights tutorial into the HandsOnSpec
x remove CliSpec
x make CliSpec running with the docker-compose
x decide whether the log level for the tests should be muted
x obfuscate user credentials in the logs
x maybe default the renku version
- adding trait for cli commands?
- commit only once at the end
